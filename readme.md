# Dataset Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains the data and code accompanying our paper [PAPER TITLE].

## Data Files

All data files required to reproduce the figures are located in `data/`:

- `final_dataset_table.csv`: Properties of each dataset family
- `final_dataset.csv`: Properties of each dataset entry 
- `final_dataset_annotated.csv`: Dataset entry annotations
- `final_dataset_gof.csv`: Goodness of Fit measures for models M1, M2, and M12 (labeled as fit1, fit2, and fit12 in the code)
- `final_dataset_profiles.csv`: Residue-dependent profiles including:
  - RMSD, lRMSD, and nlRMSD (observed and model-predicted)
  - lRMSF, nlRMSF (flexibility)
  - dactive (distance to active site)
- `final_dataset_residues.csv`: Active site residues with functional annotations from M-CSA database

## Generating Figures

### Main Figures
The main paper figures can be generated by knitting:
```R
code/make_paper_main_figures.Rmd
```
Output figures are saved to the `figures/` directory.

### Supplementary Materials
The supplementary figures and tables are generated by knitting:
```R
code/supplementary_material.Rmd
```
This produces `supplementary/supplementary_material.pdf`.

## Requirements

All analysis is performed in R.
